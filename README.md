# Restaurant-Menu-HTML
This is a HTML project for Codedex.io using HTML elements.
For this final project, I'll be doing a restaurant using HTML elements!
    I've decided to use a popular fast-food restaraunt chain in the US called
    In-N-Out, but instead I tried to be creatice and change around the restaraunt itself
    by changing the name to "Out-N-In" and a couple of items in their menu.
